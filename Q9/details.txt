ChatGPT knows I'm trying to retrieve data from a sqlite database and the query I need 
can only have subqueries, it can't be more than one single Select statement at the end.
Prompt:
I'm aiming to create a view named book_info that consolidates information about books, 
including book_id, title, review count, average rating, average rating for the year 2023, and the total request count (borrowings and waitlists).


ChatGPT generated query:
CREATE VIEW book_info AS
SELECT 
    b.book_id,
    b.title,
    COALESCE(r.revcnt, 0) AS revcnt,
    COALESCE(r.rating, 0) AS rating,
    COALESCE(r.rating23, 0) AS rating23,
    COALESCE(bor.reqcnt, 0) AS reqcnt
FROM 
    books b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        book_id,
        COUNT(rid) AS revcnt,
        AVG(rating) AS rating,
        AVG(CASE WHEN strftime('%Y', rdate) = '2023' THEN rating ELSE NULL END) AS rating23
    FROM 
        reviews
    GROUP BY 
        book_id
) r ON b.book_id = r.book_id
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        book_id,
        COUNT(bid) AS reqcnt
    FROM 
        borrowings
    GROUP BY 
        book_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        book_id,
        COUNT(wid) AS reqcnt
    FROM 
        waitlists
    GROUP BY 
        book_id
) bor ON b.book_id = bor.book_id;

My steps:
Some elements are completely unnecessary but the details look correct, generated a python script to test the sql output for ease of use for debugging.
Experimented with different conditions in the AVG(CASE WHEN ...) clause for the rating in the year 2023.
Afterwards I simplified but fixed the overall structure to ensure it captures the desired information accurately.
Fine-tuned the use of COALESCE to handle potential NULL values.
I thought about performance but apparently performance is not an issue for this assignment or so I have been told.

Prompt: 
Review my final code and tell me what you think it's doing

ChatGPT:
It looks like you're creating a view named book_info to aggregate information about books, 
including the count and average rating of reviews, the average rating for the year 2023, and the count of borrowings and waitlists.
Make sure the aggregations align with your intended logic. It seems like you are calculating 
the average rating for all reviews and the average rating for the year 2023 separately.

Date Comparison:
The condition strftime('%Y', r.rdate) = '2023' checks if the year is 2023. 
Ensure that your date format and comparison are accurate based on your database system.

Naming Conventions:
Consider using more descriptive names for your aliases, especially if this view is going to be used by others. Clear and meaningful names can enhance the readability of your queries.

My thoughts:
ChatGPT understands it and didnt really see anything wrong with the code and it passes the Github Actions tests after I add select * from book_info
