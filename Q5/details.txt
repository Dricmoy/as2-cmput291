Prompt:
Help structure a SQL query to retrieve details about books, including book_id, title, 
and the average rating from the 'reviews' table. The query should involve a JOIN with the 'books' table, 
grouping the results by book_id and title, filtering for books with at least two reviews, 
and ordering the results by average rating in descending order with a limit of 3.

ChatGPT Help:
Columns: R.book_id, B.title, AVG(R.rating) AS rating
Grouped by R.book_id and B.title
Filtered for books with at least two reviews
Ordered by average rating in descending order
Limited to 3 results

ChatGPT Help:
ChatGPT explained the usage of aggregate functions, GROUP BY for grouping results, HAVING for filtering group results,
and ORDER BY for sorting results. 

My thoughts:
select book_id, title, and the average rating, 
grouping by book_id and title, filtering for books with at least two reviews, and 
ordering the results by average rating in descending order with a limit of 3.

R.book_id (Book ID from reviews table)
B.title (Book Title)
AVG(R.rating) AS avg_rating (Average Rating)
Tables and Joins:

reviews R
JOIN books B ON R.book_id = B.book_id

Conditions:
Grouping results by R.book_id and B.title
Filtering for books with at least two reviews (HAVING COUNT(R.rid) >= 2)
Ordering:

ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
Limit:

LIMIT 3
