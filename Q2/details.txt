Prompt: Give me the basic structure for a query to get borrowing details for books with authors containing 'John' or 'Marry' in the 'CS' faculty.

Columns:
- B.bid (Borrowing ID)
- M.email AS borrower_email (Borrower's Email)
- B.end_date (End Date of Borrowing)

Tables and Joins:
- borrowings B
  - JOIN members M ON B.member = M.email
  - JOIN books BK ON B.book_id = BK.book_id

Conditions:
- Borrower's faculty must be 'CS'
- Book author must contain 'John' or 'Marry' (case-insensitive)

Result:
- Columns: B.bid, M.email AS borrower_email, B.end_date
- Filtered for 'CS' faculty and authors containing 'John' or 'Marry'

Prompt:
I sought clarification from ChatGPT on how to effectively connect values retrieved from one table's columns to another table's columns.

ChatGPT Help:
In SQL, JOIN clauses can be employed to connect values between tables. The example provided illustrated the usage of JOINs for this purpose.

My Thoughts:
To implement this insight, I decided to experiment with an INNER JOIN, focusing on connecting the Borrowings and Members tables. 
I performed this step to ensure the email-based connection worked as expected. With a successful email-based connection, I expanded the JOINs to incorporate the Books table. 
Subsequently, I refined the WHERE clause to accommodate conditions related to the 'CS' faculty and the authors 'John' or 'Marry'.

Prompt:
I raised a question regarding the application of the LOWER() function for case-insensitive author comparisons.

ChatGPT Help:
ChatGPT highlighted the common usage of the LOWER() function in SQL for case-insensitive comparisons, suggesting its application to columns like BK.author.

My Thoughts: 
Taking ChatGPT's advice, I incorporated the LOWER() function into the query to ensure case-insensitive author comparisons. 
This step aimed to enhance the query's versatility. After refining the query, I ensured
it indeed retrieves unique members who borrowed books by specified authors ('John' or 'Marry') from the 'CS' faculty by running it through Github actions.
