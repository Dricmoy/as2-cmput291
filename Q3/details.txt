Prompt: 
Help structure a SQL query to retrieve specific borrowing details from the database. 
obtain Borrowing IDs (B.bid) and borrower emails (M.email) from the 'borrowings' table, joined with the 'members' table. 
Incorporate a JOIN with the 'waitlists' table, filtering for priority levels greater than or equal to 5

ChatGPT Help:
Selects Borrowing IDs (B.bid) and borrower emails (M.email) from the 'borrowings' table, joined with the 'members' table.
Uses a LEFT JOIN with the 'waitlists' table, specifying conditions for the join (B.book_id = W.book_id AND W.priority >= 5).

Prompt:
I sought clarification from ChatGPT on how to structure a query with a LEFT JOIN, specifically with the conditions applied to the 'waitlists' table.

ChatGPT Help:
ChatGPT provided insights into the structure of a LEFT JOIN and suggested applying conditions to the 'waitlists' table in the ON clause. 
This information helped me refine the query to ensure the proper inclusion of relevant waitlist data.

Prompt:
I inquired about optimizing date calculations in the WHERE clause, particularly the use of the julianday function.

My Thoughts:
ChatGPT acknowledged the use of julianday for date calculations in SQLite. The suggestion was to apply the function to both the end_date and start_date columns for accurate duration calculations. 
I incorporated this advice into the query for precise date comparisons.
After refining the query, I wanted to confirm its functionality, specifically ensuring it retrieves borrowing details 
for instances where the borrowing duration is more than 14 days, and there is no corresponding entry in the 'waitlists' table with a priority of 5 or higher.
Developed my Query and pushed it to repo to get error so I asked how to  ensure the borrowtime is greater than 14 days.

Prompt:
Clarify how to ensure borrowing duration is greater than 14 days and filter for null entries.

ChatGPT Help:
Ensures the borrowing duration is greater than 14 days (julianday(B.end_date) - julianday(B.start_date) > 14).
Filters for cases where there is no corresponding entry in the 'waitlists' table (W.wid IS NULL), indicating the absence of a waitlist for the borrowing.
