Thoughts:
I have a general idea of creating a list of members associated with popular books. 
Combination of average rating greater than 35 and a request count higher than the average request count means the book is popular.

ChatGPT Help:
I sought guidance from ChatGPT on how to structure a query that involves filtering for popular books based on average 
rating and request count. 
ChatGPT provided insights into the JOIN operation and demonstrated an example similar to my output in Query 1.

My Thoughts:
With ChatGPT's input, I began by joining the 'members' table with 'borrowings' and the 'book_info' view. 
I then incorporated the conditions for popularity: a rating greater than 35 and a request count higher than the calculated average request count.

Intermediate Steps:
1. Joined 'members' with 'borrowings' on member email.
2. Extended the JOIN to include the 'book_info' view on the book_id.
3. Incorporated the conditions for popularity: rating > 35 and reqcnt > average request count.

After refining the query, I used my python script to confirm its functionality. Specifically, I verified that the query successfully retrieves a 
list of members associated with popular books, based on the defined criteria. The JOIN operations and subquery enhance the query's specificity.
