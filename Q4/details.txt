Prompt:
Help structure a SQL query for retrieving specific details from the database. 
The goals I gave to ChatGPT was to obtain information about books, including book_id, title, author, the count of borrowings (borrow_count), 
and the most recent borrowing start date (most_recent_borrow_date). Include a LEFT JOIN with the 'Borrowings' table, 
filtering books published after 2001, and grouping the results by book_id.

ChatGPT Help:
```sql
SELECT Books.book_id, Books.title, Books.author,
    AS borrow_count,
    AS most_recent_borrow_date
FROM Books
LEFT JOIN Borrowings ON Books.book_id = Borrowings.book_id

Second Prompt:
I sought clarification from ChatGPT on the usage of aggregate functions, particularly COUNT and MAX, in combination with a LEFT JOIN and GROUP BY.

ChatGPT Help:
ChatGPT explained the usage of aggregate functions in SQL, highlighting that COUNT() can be used to count the number of rows, 
and MAX() can find the maximum value in a column. In this context, they are applied to count borrowings and find the most recent borrowing start date. 
The LEFT JOIN ensures all books are included, even if they have no borrowings.

My Thoughts:
I proceeded with the provided query structure, leveraging the insights from ChatGPT regarding the usage of aggregate functions, 
LEFT JOIN, and GROUP BY to achieve the desired outcome. After refining the query, I aimed to confirm its functionality, 
specifically ensuring it retrieves information about books, including the count of borrowings and the most recent borrowing start date, for books published after 2001.
